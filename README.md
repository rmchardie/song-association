Inspired by a YouTube video I watched, the aim of the game is to sing a song with the displayed word before the timer runs out.  If you can, you win a trophy.

Each list contains 10 words and the game consists of 4 levels.  There are 3 timer settings to challenge yourself.

The app will store your name to local storage once you enter it on the intro page.
